            <p>Our Path to Buy program is a great asset to homeowners looking to purchase but might not have the credit scores, down payment,
                and/or enough income to qualify just yet. Credit repair can be costly, frustrating, and even confusing depending on what
                company you work with and a lot of buyers are left in the dark about whether or not it's working and how long the repair will
                take. With our Path To Buy Program, that is free of charge to our clients, we are able to give prospective buyers a
                personalized game plan with everything they need to do in order to get their credit scores up, help with down payment assistance
                or help in determining how to get their debt ratios where they need to be to qualify and we even give you a timeline so you know
                exactly when to expect these changes to take effect! No more guessing, wondering which cards to pay off, and playing the waiting
                game. If you want to purchase a home - and credit score, down payment or high balances, are what is stopping you, or your just
                nervous and don’t know where to start, our Path to Buy Program will get you on track to securing your dream of building wealth
                through homeownership!</p>

            <p>Our hearts really lie with our First Time Homebuyers. There is nothing that is more rewarding to us than to help our clients build
                wealth with homeownership. We will show you how – we won’t tell you “NO”!! If it takes us 30 days or 30 months – we will NOT forget
                about you and goals!</p>
